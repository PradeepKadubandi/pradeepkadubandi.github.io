In this work, we explore infusing motion planning algorithms as an expert to drive the generalization performance or sample efficiency in visuomotor policy learning. Prior work explored end to end learning, auto encoders or pose based policies in training the visual portion of visuomotor policies. We focus our attention instead on guiding the policy learning using motion planner and combining with an auto encoder to achieve good end to end performance with only a few samples. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such end to end policies and compare their performance with prior work.
