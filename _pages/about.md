Recently I did a Masters in Computer Sciene at University of Southern California (USC) with Intelligent Robotics speclialization. I am fortunate to work in 3 different research labs during this time. My work in RESL lab has been accepted to Machine Learning for Motion Planning workshop in ICRA'21. Refer to [publications](https://pradeepkadubandi.github.io/publications/).

Prior to that, I've been a software engineer for more than a decade building various systems and products.
